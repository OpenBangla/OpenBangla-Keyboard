# OpenBangla Keyboard (OBK)

OpenBangla Keyboard is an open-source, Unicode-compliant Bangla input method built with Rust and C++ for GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows. As an incredibly fast, high-performance, cross-platform solution, it features advanced automation tools and supports popular layouts such as Avro Phonetic, Probhat, Munir Optima, and National (Jatiya).

Most features of [Avro Keyboard](https://github.com/mugli/Avro-Keyboard) are included here. This makes OBK familiar and intuitive for longtime Avro Keyboard users.
