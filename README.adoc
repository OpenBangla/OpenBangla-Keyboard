=== Archlinux and it's derivatives
TIP: There is a video tutorial about installing OpenBangla Keyboard in Arch Linux. You may check that out from https://youtu.be/C8vnR1AY6sA[here].

There are two packages for OpenBangla Keyboard in the Arch User Repository(AUR). Use `openbangla-keyboard` if you want to make and install the package from source.
